# TaskFlow AI Features Roadmap

This document outlines the AI features that can be implemented in TaskFlow, along with clear testing steps for each feature to ensure they function correctly.

## 1. Natural Language Task Management

### 1.1 Task Creation via Natural Language
**Description:** Allow users to create tasks using natural language commands with automatic context verification and validation.

**Implementation:**
- Parse user input to extract task parameters (title, description, due date, assignee, priority)
- Map dates and relative time references ("tomorrow", "next week") to actual dates
- Extract mentions of team members for assignment
- Verify required context (workspace, project, sprint) exists or prompt user to select from options
- Validate all task parameters before creation
- Display confirmation with extracted parameters before executing the command
- Provide status feedback during and after task creation

**Context Verification Flow:**
1. Detect if a project context is missing in the command
2. Query database for the user's accessible projects
3. Present actual project options to the user for selection
4. Remember the selected project for future commands in the same session
5. If sprint context is needed but missing, query for available sprints in the selected project
6. For assignee mentions, validate against actual team members

**Testing Steps:**
1. Enter command: "Create a high priority task for fixing the login page bug due next Friday"
2. Verify the AI prompts for required context: "Which project should I create this task in?" with a list of your actual projects
3. Select a project from the provided options
4. Verify the AI correctly extracts and confirms:
   - Title: "Fixing the login page bug"
   - Priority: "High"
   - Due date: Next Friday's date (should show the actual calculated date)
   - Project: The selected project name
5. Confirm the task creation preview shows all parameters correctly
6. Approve creation and verify the task appears in the project with all attributes set correctly
7. Verify an activity record is created for this task creation

**Edge Case Testing:**
1. Test with ambiguous commands: "Create a task about the homepage"
   - Verify AI asks for additional details like priority and due date
2. Test with missing project context but within a project page:
   - Verify AI automatically uses the current project without asking
3. Test with an invalid team member: "Create task assigned to UserWhoDoesntExist"
   - Verify AI provides error feedback and alternative user suggestions
4. Test with past due dates: "Create task due yesterday"
   - Verify AI flags this and asks for confirmation

### 1.2 Task Updates via Natural Language
**Description:** Allow users to update existing tasks using natural language.

**Testing Steps:**
1. With a task selected or in context, enter: "Change the due date to next Monday"
2. Verify the AI correctly identifies:
   - The action: Update task
   - The field: Due date
   - The new value: Next Monday's date
3. Confirm the update preview appears with correct information
4. Submit and verify task is updated accordingly

### 1.3 Bulk Task Operations
**Description:** Process commands that affect multiple tasks at once.

**Testing Steps:**
1. Enter command: "Move all UI-related tasks to Sprint 3"
2. Verify the AI:
   - Lists all tasks matching "UI-related"
   - Shows the destination (Sprint 3)
   - Displays a confirmation dialog
3. Confirm and verify all tasks are moved correctly

## 2. Context-Aware Assistance

### 2.1 Project Context Awareness
**Description:** AI retains and uses project context throughout a conversation.

**Testing Steps:**
1. Navigate to a specific project "Marketing Website"
2. Ask: "Show me the tasks in the current sprint"
3. Verify AI returns tasks for the Marketing Website's current sprint without asking for project clarification
4. Ask a follow-up: "Who's assigned the most tasks?"
5. Verify AI maintains project context and answers correctly

### 2.2 Missing Context Resolution
**Description:** AI requests missing context when needed and remembers it for future interactions.

**Testing Steps:**
1. From the home dashboard (no project context), ask: "Show me overdue tasks"
2. Verify AI asks for project context with options from your actual projects
3. Select a project from the provided options
4. Verify correct overdue tasks are displayed
5. Ask another question: "When does the current sprint end?"
6. Verify AI uses previously selected project context without asking again

## 3. Sprint and Planning Assistance

### 3.1 Sprint Progress Summarization
**Description:** Generate concise summaries of sprint progress.

**Testing Steps:**
1. Enter command: "Summarize the current sprint progress"
2. Verify summary includes:
   - Percentage of tasks completed
   - Burndown chart or completion rate
   - Tasks at risk (due soon but not started)
   - Most active contributors
3. Verify all information is accurate compared to the actual sprint dashboard

### 3.2 Sprint Planning Recommendations
**Description:** Provide AI-assisted sprint planning based on backlog and team capacity.

**Testing Steps:**
1. Enter command: "Suggest tasks for next sprint"
2. Verify recommendations include:
   - Prioritized backlog items
