# TaskFlow AI Features Implementation

## Overview

TaskFlow's AI features are designed to enhance productivity and streamline project management workflows. Our AI assistant helps users create and manage tasks, automate workflows, and receive intelligent suggestions using natural language processing.

## Current Implementation: Natural Language Task Management

### Features

- **Natural Language Command Processing**: Users can create, update, and manage tasks using everyday language
- **Intent Recognition**: The AI identifies the user's intent (create task, move task, generate subtasks)
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically extracts details like task title, assignee, due date, and priority
- **Confirmation Interface**: All AI-suggested actions require user confirmation before execution
- **Command Suggestions**: Context-aware suggestions based on project status and user activity

### User Flow

1. User clicks the AI assistant button in the dashboard
2. A chat window opens where the user can type natural language commands
3. The AI interprets the command and displays a confirmation with extracted details
4. User confirms or corrects the interpretation
5. The system executes the confirmed action (e.g., creates a task)

### Example Commands

- "Create a bug task about login page error due next Tuesday assigned to Sarah"
- "Move all UI-related tasks to Sprint 3"
- "Generate 5 subtasks for the user onboarding feature"
- "Show me all high-priority tasks due this week"
- "Summarize the progress on the current sprint"

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service Integration

The AI feature implementation includes:

1. **AI Service Layer (`src/lib/ai-service.ts`)**:
   - Handles communication with the Azure AI Inference API
   - Manages conversation context and state
   - Processes natural language input and structures responses

2. **API Routes**:
   - `/api/ai/chat`: Handles general AI conversations
   - `/api/ai/parse-task`: Specifically parses task-related commands

3. **UI Components**:
   - `AIChatWindow`: Floating chat interface for AI interactions
   - Confirmation dialogs for task creation and updates

### Setup Requirements

To use the AI features, you need:

1. A GitHub token with access to the GitHub AI model
2. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in `.env.local`
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @azure-rest/ai-inference @azure/core-auth
   ```

### Security Considerations

- All AI requests are authenticated with Clerk user sessions
- Sensitive project data is never stored in the AI service
- AI responses are validated before executing actions
- All AI-suggested actions require explicit user confirmation

## Upcoming Enhancements

In the next phase, we'll extend the AI features to include:

- **Sprint Planning Automation**: Generate sprint suggestions based on project backlog
- **Task Description Enhancement**: Improve task descriptions with AI-generated content
- **Smart Task Prioritization**: Suggest task priorities based on dependencies and deadlines
- **Meeting Summary Integration**: Create tasks from meeting notes and summaries

## Feedback and Iteration

We're continuously improving our AI features based on user feedback. The implementation follows an iterative approach:

1. Collect user feedback on AI suggestions and command recognition
2. Monitor AI usage patterns to identify common commands and edge cases
3. Regularly update the AI system prompts to improve accuracy and relevance
4. Expand the range of supported natural language commands based on user needs

## Future AI Features

As outlined in our product roadmap, upcoming AI features include:

- **AI-Powered Documentation**: Automatically generate project documentation
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Personalized, context-aware notifications
- **Workflow Optimization**: Suggestions for improving team workflows
- **Predictive Analytics**: Project timeline and resource requirement forecasts
