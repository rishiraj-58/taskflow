2. **Enhanced User Roles & Permissions** - Expand role-based access control
3. **Activity Logging** - Implement comprehensive audit trails
4. **Workspace Customization** - Allow users to personalize their workspace with branding

## AI Features Roadmap (Next Generation)
After completing the core functionality and addressing critical bugs, the next evolution of TaskFlow will focus on AI-powered automation and assistance:

1. **Natural Language Interface** - Allow users to interact with the system using plain English commands
2. **Intelligent Automation** - Streamline workflows with AI-driven automation of routine tasks
3. **Predictive Insights** - Leverage historical data to provide predictive analytics and proactive suggestions
4. **Content Enhancement** - Improve user-generated content with AI-assisted editing and formatting
5. **Smart Notifications** - Deliver timely and relevant notifications based on user behavior and project context

## Comprehensive AI Features Implementation

### AI Implementation Approach
Our AI assistant will use a middleware logic layer rather than purely text-based responses:

1. **User Message Flow:**
   - User enters a natural language request (e.g., "Show me tasks in Sprint 2")
   - AI parses the request and returns structured action data:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "FIND_TASKS",
     "parameters": {
       "sprintId": "abc123",
       "projectId": "taskflow123"
     }
   }
   ```
   - Backend logic processes the action type and parameters
   - System performs actual database/API queries
   - Results are formatted and returned to the user

2. **Integration Components:**
   - Action router that maps AI action types to API endpoints
   - Parameter validator for security and data integrity
   - Context manager for maintaining conversation state
   - Response formatter for consistent user experience

### Core TaskFlow AI Actions

- **AUTOMATED_RELEASE_NOTES** - Write release summary based on sprint contents
- **MEETING_RECAP_GENERATOR** - Summarize notes + tasks from a meeting transcript

### Context-Aware Behavior
The AI assistant will be designed to:
- Ask follow-up questions only when essential context is missing
- Present actual options from the database for user selection
- Remember context throughout the conversation
- Interpret ambiguous terms based on project context
- Provide intelligent error recovery if commands can't be executed

### Technical Implementation Details
- System prompt contains actual project schema
- Integration with Prisma for database calls
- Real-time verification of context
- Error handling with fallback options
- Date processing for relative time references

## Development Guidelines
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Ensure all features work seamlessly on mobile devices
2. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for maximum accessibility
3. **Testing**: Write tests for critical functionality
4. **Documentation**: Document code and create user guides as you build
5. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy frequently to get early feedback

Remember to prioritize features that address the most critical pain points first, and build a solid foundation before adding advanced functionality.
